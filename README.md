# Webscrapping-lesson-with-BeautifulSoup

This project is part of a lesson posted in my blog [here](https://imuliterno.netlify.app/) . There we go trough [horse statistics website](http://www.racebase.co.nz/jockthis.htm), [jockeys and trainers statistics website](https://loveracing.nz) and extract info in order to make some analysis.

1. extract runs
2. get combination of jockey-horse-trainer for each run
